# SiteMap files

Included here are the SiteMap input files used to assess the volume of pockets formed in the protein structure during simulation, and the corresponding results:
- The .log files contain the analysed pocket volume.
- The pocket volume coordinate .pdb files were used for molecular visualisations in Figure 3A and 3C.
